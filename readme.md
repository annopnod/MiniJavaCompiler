### Mini Java Compiler ###

* `test.py` runs 'positive' and 'failing' tests to show performance and precise compile-time errors when fails
* tests are located at `JavaExamples/` dir.
* when running with 'ast', `.dot` files with AST representation are outputted to `TestOutput/` dir

#### Check out 'fac' (factorial) test :)
